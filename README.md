# AES_CSharp_GUI

This is a small AES Text Encryption file editor which utilizes the C# Cryptography namespace in order to experiment with the concept of GUI-oriented programming structure,
User Interface testing, and general C# programming methodology.

It was originally inspired by programs such as AES Crypt, with the intention of being packaged with a smaller footprint.

This is also one of my first endeavors into a cross-platform application capable of running on Windows and Linux which will likely require creative solutions to the custom
file explorer solution and some work with Mono.
